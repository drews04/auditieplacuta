# HEADER/CONTENT OVERLAP FIX ✅

## Root Cause Identified

The header was changed from `position: absolute` to `position: relative` (which was correct), but the page content still had padding designed for an absolute header.

### Problem:
- **Before:** Header was `position: absolute` (taken out of document flow)
- **Content had:** `padding-top: 170px` to avoid overlap with absolute header
- **After Phase 2:** Header changed to `position: relative` (in document flow)
- **Result:** Header takes up space + 170px padding = HUGE GAP and visual overlap

## Changes Summary

| Element | Before | After | Reason |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|

## What This Fixes

✅ **Home page:** No more huge gap between header and content  
✅ **Forum page:** Content no longer overlaps header  
✅ **Evenimente page:** Shows professional "În construcție" message  
✅ **All pages:** Header and content flow naturally

## Verification

### Before:
- Header and content appeared to overlap
- Huge vertical gap on home page
- Blur on header text (separate issue, already fixed in Phase 3)

### After:
- Clean transition from header to content
- 60px comfortable spacing
- No overlap anywhere
- Crystal clear header text

## Why 60px?

- Header height: ~80-90px (with padding)
- Natural visual breathing room: 60px
- Total space before content: ~140-150px (header + padding)
- Perfect balance for modern web design
